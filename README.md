# Autonomous-Navigation-Robot-using-Reinforcement-Learning-in-Gazebo
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an autonomous navigation robot that can effectively navigate through a predefined world. The robot will be trained using reinforcement learning algorithms in the Gazebo simulation environment.
The robot will be equipped with sensors to perceive its environment and actuators to move around. The robotâ€™s task is to learn to navigate from a starting point to a goal location, avoiding obstacles and minimizing travel time.

Key Features 
1. ROS Integration :
   The Robot Operating System (ROS) will be used for controlling the robot, processing sensor data, and implementing the reinforcement learning      algorithm.

2. Gazebo Simulation:
   Gazebo, a powerful robot simulator, will be used to create a realistic 3D world with various obstacles. The robot will be trained in this 
   simulated environment before being deployed in the real world.

3. Reinforcement Learning:
   The robot will use reinforcement learning, specifically Q-Learning, to learn the optimal policy for navigation. The robot will receive rewards    for reaching the goal and penalties for colliding with obstacles or taking too long to reach the goal
